<p>AI is becoming more and more of a requirement for JavaScript development projects. You can use AI technologies for UI enhancements, as well as built upon several AIs with JavaScript. As we move toward a world where more AI programming is normalized, the JavaScript ecosystem contains tools to make your work as a developer easier. In this course, software developer and instructor Eve Porcello surveys the options available and shows you how to build chat and text analysis programs that use JavaScript libraries in Node.js.</p>

<p>After taking the course, you will be able to analyze text and build chat applications that have a structured output. You will also learn how to save results to databases that are familiar to many JavaScript developers.</p>

<p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started.</p>

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
Add changes to git using this command: git add .
Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing

1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) at version 18 or higher.
   - A code editor of some sort. The instructor will use VSCode.
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
